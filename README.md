# WebGym
A port of OpenAI's Gym for the Internet!

A simple VR game that utilizes Dr. Eelke Folmer's VR-STEP algorithm for accurate locomotion tracking in mobile VR without need for IR cameras. Developed at the University of Nevada, Reno.

You can play this game on your Android smartphone! Clone this repo and download it on your computer as an Android APK. Stick your phone in a VR headset and go for the highest score!

## Getting Started

To get started, download both files and open in your code editor. Run the Python server file, and type in `localhost:8080` into your web browser. Have fun trying to play the game! 

To change the environment (from say, [LunarLander](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/) to [Acrobot](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Acrobot-v1/)), simply change the name in `server.py`.

## Notes

You'll probably be interested in the keystrokes and corresponding reward values generated by human gameplay; this data currently prints in the terminal, and can be saved by sending the results of the server.py to some output file, as so:
```console
foo@bar:~$ python3 server.py > output.txt
```
