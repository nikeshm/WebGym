# WebGym
A port of OpenAI's Gym for the Internet!

The [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) is a a very popular toolkit for developing, testing, and optimizing reinforcement learning models. Currently, only automated algorithms can interact with the gym, making organic human data collection quite difficult; this project is meant to remediate that, and provide a novel way to collect real-world data for RL model development.


## Getting Started

To get started, download the files and open in your code editor. Install the requirements; if you're using pip, then you can run the following command:

```console
foo@bar:~$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Python `server.py` file. Once the program begins running, type in `localhost:8080` into your web browser. Have fun playing with the Gym! 

To change the environment (from say, [LunarLander](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/) to [Acrobot](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Acrobot-v1/)), simply change the name in `server.py`.

## Notes

You'll probably be interested in the keystrokes and corresponding reward values generated by human gameplay; this data currently prints in the terminal, and can be saved by sending the results of the server.py to some output file, as so:
```console
foo@bar:~$ python server.py > output.txt
```
